# Roman Singh . Jarvis Consulting

I graduated from McMaster University with a B.Sc. in Physics and a background in computer science. I am currently employed at Jarvis Consulting Group with the intent to gain more hands-on experience in software development through working on various exciting projects and utilizing various technologies and frameworks. Working at Jarvis Consulting Group has also allowed me to exercise skills in scrum, agile, time management, and collaboration.  My programming experiences during my undergrad classes sparked my interest in software development. I highly enjoy problem-solving and the dynamic nature of the profession is what excites me most.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_RomanSingh](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_RomanSingh)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_RomanSingh/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a monitoring agent that can track the hardware specifications and usage of various nodes and store their data in a database. The monitoring agent was developed through the use of bash scripts and utilized a PostgresSQL database, provisioned by docker. Bash scripts were programmed to extract hardware specs, while crontab would provide periodic updates of the usage data. Manual testing was done by running bash scripts on the terminal to ensure the results were as expected.

**Grep App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_RomanSingh/tree/master/core_java)]: Created an app that mimics the Linux Grep command, allowing users to search for matching strings. The project was implemented using Java along with Lambda and Stream APIs. Automated testing was done using JUnit to make sure functions behaved as intended, along with manual testing to output file was correct. The app was packaged using Maven and deployed on Docker Hub using Docker.


## Highlighted Projects
**MusicX**: Built a full-stack scalable collaborative music-playing web app, by developing a REST API using Python Django REST framework, to connect to the Spotify API, enabling guests in a room to vote on playing/pausing, or skipping a song. The front-end was developed using React to create the pages, along with material UI components to add style. Manual testing was done to ensure the web pages behaved as intended. The website was hosted using a free python website.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2021-Present)**: Developed agile methodologies by collaborating with a scrum team to develop and implement numerous projects utilizing technologies such as Linux, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Git. Assisted others in project-related issues, and held daily scrum meetings as a scrum leader.
