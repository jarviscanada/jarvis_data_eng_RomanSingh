# Roman Singh . Jarvis Consulting

I've graduated in 2019 with a B.Sc. in Physics at McMaster University. I am currently employed at Jarvis Consulting Group with the intent to gain more hands-on experience in software development, through working on various exciting projects and utilizing various technologies and frameworks. My programming experiences during my undergrad classes sparked my interest in software development. I highly enjoy problem-solving and the dynamic nature of the profession is what excites me most.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_RomanSingh/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Utilized a PostgreSQL database, provisioned by Docker, to develop a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent. This would allow users to extract hardware specifications and server usage data of each node in the system. Bash scripts were programmed to extract hardware specs, while crontab would provide periodic updates of the usage data.

## Highlighted Projects
**MusicX**: Built a full-stack scalable collaborative music playing web app, by developing a REST API using Django REST framework, to connect to the third-party Spotify API, enabling guests in a room to vote on playing/pausing, or skipping a song. The front-end was developed using React to create the pages, along with material UI components to add style.
