   description: "Implemented a monitoring agent that can track the hardware specifications and usage of various nodes and store their data in a database. The monitoring agent was developed through the use of bash scripts and utilized a PostgresSQL database, provisioned by docker. Bash scripts were programmed to extract hardware specs, while crontab would provide periodic updates of the usage data. Manual testing was done by running bash scripts on the terminal to ensure the results were as expected."

    "Created an app that mimics the Linux Grep command, allowing users to search for matching strings. The project was implemented using Java along with Lambda and Stream APIs. Automated testing was done using JUnit to make sure functions behaved as intended, along with manual testing to ensure the output file was correct. The app was packaged using Maven and deployed on Docker Hub using Docker."

    description: "Built a full-stack scalable collaborative music-playing web app, by developing a REST API using Python Django REST framework, to connect to the Spotify API, enabling guests in a room to vote on playing/pausing, or skipping a song. The front-end was developed using React to create the pages, along with material UI components to add style. Manual testing was done to ensure the web pages behaved as intended. The website was hosted using a free python website."
